    'content' => '#WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND?
    My name is Naz Mir, I’m a second-generation Bangladeshi immigrant (mixed with Welsh heritage) from London. Throughout my professional career I’ve had the privilege to rotate around different specialisms in People functions including Organisational Development, HR Systems and People Partnering, but for the last 10 years I have found my professional (and personal) home in Diversity & Inclusion (D&I). 
    #YOU ARE DIVERSITY & INCLUSION LEAD AT MONZO BANK. WHAT DOES THAT ROLE INVOLVE?
    On paper, ultimately I’m responsible for ensuring Monzo has a Diversity & Inclusion strategy that supports all our people thriving at work regardless of their background — but my role is so much more than that! It’s extremely varied and requires many different disciplines and skills including D&I knowledge (of course!), change management, coaching, data analytics, facilitator, connector and listener, to name a few. Whilst D&I can feel like a big responsibility, it’s one that is shared by many at Monzo: it truly is a team effort. When I joined the business, I was amazed to see how many people have taken personal responsibility to incorporate D&I into their day jobs. So a truer representation of my role is to help scale that passion for D&I in all of Monzo. If I can unlock 2% D&I leadership in everyone’s role then we continue to build D&I as an authentic part of who we are, not just what we do. 
    #HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK A CLIMATE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IS, BOTH IN THE CORPORATE WORKSPACE AND IN THE WIDER WORLD?
    It’s critical. I say this because, no matter who we are, we live our lives in it every day.
    In the wider world, we can’t ignore there’s a spotlight on Diversity & Inclusion at the moment. It’s really important we remember that a lot of the freedoms we have today are afforded to us from past struggles for a better tomorrow. This is what D&I at its heart is about. In the corporate workspace, I think people are looking for more human connections. In a post-Covid, AI-driven world, it’s easy for working relationships to feel slightly transactional.
    We all seem busier, and with more priorities in and outside of work, so inclusion seeks to help build those moments of magic into each interaction, reminding ourselves that behind the colleague is an entire person with ambitions, hopes and lives seeking enrichment.',

    'content' => '#AND HOW DO WE CREATE THAT POSITIVE CLIMATE?
    We can’t give back until we are looking after ourselves, so, particularly for people from our LGBTQ+ community, I’ve been encouraging everyone to breathe and take a minute, because there is a lot going on. It’s easy for us to feel powerless when there are some macro changes at play. I always come back to being guided by your purpose, the values you hold dear and letting those move you to action. I think about the question, “What do I actually have control over, what can I influence and what is beyond my control?” (helpful model from [author and businessman] Stephen Covey).
    I then take personal responsibility  to show up with empathy and understanding for those around me. Sometimes, all it takes  is to listen. I think if all we can do is give  each other that space and respect, we will be creating a more positive climate. Being  your most inclusive self is so personal to each person, so others may be wanting to get more involved in causes important to them. In the workplace, speak with your diversity and inclusion team or employee networks about how to take part, or externally, you  can look to your favourite charities to see  what causes they are supporting at the moment.

    'content' => '#WE’VE COME A LONG WAY IN LGBTQ+ RIGHTS. WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE?
    I think the most important thing to remember is that even though we’ve come a long way, those things aren’t permanent. And this really is relevant to all communities that have made progress in recent times: there is a lot more to be done. We’re in a position as a community where both things can be true, we have made progress, but our rights are also currently being voted away.
    As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, my personal priority recently has been to support the most marginalised within our community. I can’t speak for all, but currently my trans and non-binary friends are sharing with me how afraid they are given recent developments. It’s not a new thing ؅— there have always been members of our community who have been silenced and more vulnerable — and I take personal responsibility to support them. It’s important to remember that the power of oppression doesn’t really differentiate when it comes to “different”.
    Taking someone else’s rights away makes it all that much easier to take yours away next. ',

    'content' => '#WHAT IS THE ONE THING YOU’VE BEEN PROUDEST OF?
    It’s always amazing and career-affirming when you hear about the positive experiences people have had because of the work you’ve put out there, but it’s never you working in isolation! 
    So the thing I’m proudest of is the network of people I’ve encountered in my career who do not necessarily get paid to work on diversity and inclusion and yet they show up every day to make a difference, not for themselves, but for those around them. It’s been the greatest joy of my career to be surrounded by people who know there’s a better future out there and are happy to work towards it. So many of them are still in my life as a trusted network and group that I can turn to for ideas, laughter and moments of much needed decompression.
