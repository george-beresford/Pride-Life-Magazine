    'content' => '#WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND?
    I’m Diogo Vieira da Silva. Professionally, my journey has spanned multiple areas such as international commerce, hospitality and tourism management, and digital marketing, supported by an International MBA and executive education.
    Throughout my career, I’ve taken on various roles that allowed me to drive innovation, strategic communication, and foster environments committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
    Alongside my “day job”, I have dedicated much of my life to activism - what I affectionately call my “gay job”.
    I started early, at 16, by initiating a student-led movement aimed at integrating comprehensive sexual education into Portuguese schools. By the age of 18, I had founded my first NGO, establishing Porto’s first physical space specifically designed for marginalised communities, including the LGBTI+ community, sex workers, and individuals living with HIV. My professional trajectory has always been deeply intertwined with my commitment to social impact, consistently combining clear objectives with meaningful outcomes and social empowerment.
    #YOU ARE IMPACT CENTERS OFFICER AT THE INNOVATION X HUB OF PORTO BUSINESS SCHOOL. WHAT DOES THAT ROLE INVOLVE?
    As Impact Centers Officer, my role involves coordinating strategic initiatives across several specialised centres at the Innovation X Hub, including sustainability, entrepreneurship, tourism, real estate, Africa, and AI. I facilitate collaborations between academia, industry leaders, and policymakers, focusing on driving innovation, applied research, educational programs, community engagement, and attracting investment to create meaningful societal and economic impacts.',

    'content' => '#YOU ARE ALSO CO-FOUNDER OF VARIAÇÕES. WHAT IS VARIAÇÕES AND WHAT DOES IT DO?
    Variações is actually the third NGO I’ve founded. My journey in activism started with CASA – Centro Avançado de Sexualidade e Afectos, which served as Porto’s first community centre dedicated to supporting vulnerable and marginalised communities. The second was It Gets Better Portugal, the official Portuguese affiliate of the global It Gets Better Project, which I introduced to Portugal in 2012. Later, as European Coordinator of It Gets Better from 2017 to 2018, I amplified the positive impact of storytelling within the LGBTI+ community across Europe.
    Variações, Portugal’s LGBTI+ Commerce and Tourism Association, came about while I was working at a gay hotel in Lisbon. It struck me deeply how disconnected LGBTI+ businesses were despite their significant potential. Motivated by this, I established Variações in 2018 to organise and strategically support the sector nationally. This led to the groundbreaking “Proudly Portugal” campaign in 2019, Portugal’s first-ever promotional campaign highlighting the country as an inclusive LGBTI+ destination. Our efforts culminated in Lisbon being chosen to host EuroPride 2025, a candidacy I led in 2022.
    Most recently, as Coordinator General of Porto Pride, I facilitated its transition into an independent organisation. ',

    'content' => '#HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK A CLIMATE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IS, BOTH IN THE CORPORATE WORKSPACE AND IN THE WIDER WORLD
    Creating a climate of diversity and inclusion is essential, especially when we look at the challenges faced by the LGBTI+ community in terms of employment. Historically, queer individuals have encountered significant barriers to accessing stable employment, making it crucial to support and encourage LGBTI+ businesses that actively hire queer people. Additionally, fostering an environment where queer individuals feel empowered to become entrepreneurs and create their own means of livelihood is incredibly important. This autonomy helps break down systemic barriers, promotes economic independence, and ultimately contributes to building a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
    #AND HOW DO WE CREATE THAT POSITIVE CLIMATE?
    Creating a positive climate starts with genuine leadership commitment, inclusive policies, ongoing education, and active listening. It involves transparent hiring practices, training on unconscious bias, and clear accountability measures. Additionally, it’s vital to support Pride events actively. In a world where countries, including the USA, are increasingly pushing back against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, companies and brands that choose to support Pride events in the current climate demonstrate a sincere commitment - not just marketing strategies - to fostering inclusivity and standing with marginalised communities. Ultimately, a culture that genuinely celebrates diversity and embeds inclusion into every action is key.',

    'content' => '#PRIDE – PARTY OR POLITICS?
    Both. Pride is undeniably political — it was born out of protest and continues to advocate for visibility and rights. But it’s also a celebration of how far we’ve come, of resilience, of love, and of the joy in being who we are.
    And beyond the flags and glitter, Pride is also a vital space to uplift and give a platform to queer artists who rarely get the visibility they deserve. It’s about showcasing our talent, our culture, and our voices.
    As someone who helps organise a Pride, I’ve come to understand that we are not the owners of the movement — we are simply its temporary guardians, with the responsibility to protect it, honour its legacy, and pass it on stronger than we found it.',
