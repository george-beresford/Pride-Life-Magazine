    'content' => '#WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND?
    My name is Lexie Shaibu-Lenoir, and I have spent the last 20 years working as a hospitality and event professional. I’m proud to have founded the first wedding planning company dedicated exclusively to LGBTQ+ couples. I also sit on the LGBTQIA+ Advisory Board for Belmond, and I’m the Head of Commercial Operations at UK Black Pride.
    #YOU ARE AN HOSPITALITY & EVENT PROFESSIONAL. WHAT DOES THAT ROLE INVOLVE?
    Throughout my professional career, I’ve primarily worked in luxury hotels and event venues. This industry has truly shaped me, and I’ve gained invaluable experience over the years.
    Working in hotels involves comprehensive training programs covering a wide range of topics, from wine knowledge and customer service to regular food tastings for product understanding and effective complaint resolution. My experience with catering companies has further broadened my understanding of operations across various venues.
    #WE’VE ARGUABLY COME A LONG WAY IN LGBTQ+ RIGHTS IN THE PAST DECADES. SHOULD WE JUST REST ON OUR LAURELS – OR IS THERE MORE TO BE DONE?
    We have definitely made a lot of progress in advancing LGBTQ+ rights, however there is always more to be done in the community. The LGBTQ+ community are the most marginalised people, and being a queer black woman adds another layer to it. We’re witnessing trans rights being taken away, and the trans community being constantly under attack. Racism is rife across multiple sectors and our peers feel unsafe on a daily basis in their own home, at work, and outside. For this reason, we must continue to stand up for our community.',

    'content' => '#ON A PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL LEVEL WHAT IS THE ONE THING YOU’VE BEEN PROUDEST OF? 
    I’m proud to have married a woman (Aisha Shaibu-Lenoir) who shares the same values as me and is doing a wonderful job for the community. She’s the Director of The Common Press which is a queer intersectional bookshop in Brick Lane and she’s put on some amazing events and done a lot to raise funds to keep the place open. It’s a safe space with a lot of great resources, where you can have a tea and a natter and connect with others. I’m inspired by her and she keeps pushing me to break boundaries every day and be the best version of myself. ',

    'content' => '#YOU ARE ALSO HEAD OF COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF UK BLACK PRIDE. WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR A BLACK PRIDE? 
    When people create spaces that are not inclusive and where you don’t feel welcome, you create your own. This is the reason why I created Queer Weddings in the first place. UK Black Pride has been born out of the sheer desire to welcome those who have felt excluded elsewhere. We have had up to 25,000 people attend and it is a privilege for our team to put on this event every year. We welcome around 250 volunteers who dedicate hours of their time to help us make this event a success. Lady Phyll is an absolute inspiration, a great leader, and has dedicated her life to the cause to ensure black and POC people are never forgotten.
    #WHAT’S A TYPICAL DAY FOR LEXIE SHAIBU-LENOIR? 
    There is never a typical day in my life! I could be planning a wedding one day, travelling the next day (I’m writing this piece from a beautiful hotel in Cape Town!), being part of a panel to discuss inclusivity, helping my wife with her business, running an event, or planning a group trip. My purpose is to serve the community in whatever capacity I can with all the skills I have gained over the years.',

    'content' => '#YOU’RE GIVEN THREE WISHES – WHAT WOULD THEY BE? 
    This is a hard one because I have a long list of wishes I would love to make happen. But liberation, equal rights, and equity for all. We need to have a more balanced system that will benefit everyone, not just the super rich.
    #PRIDE – PARTY OR POLITICS? 
    Absolutely both! Having said that, politics comes before the party. We need to keep fighting for our rights and ensure that everyone is included in the fight. We can celebrate ourselves whilst ensuring that we are also part of the political discourse.',
