    'content' => '#WHO ARE YOU WHAT AND IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND? 
    For more than 25 years I’ve worked in retail marketing roles for high street retailers including Boots and Tesco and creative agencies and spent three years in Germany at the International School of Hamburg. My multi award-winning work and experiences span all aspects of the advertising and marketing mix and I’ve covered all communication disciplines.
    #YOU’RE HEAD OF CONTENT, SOCIAL MEDIA & INFLUENCERS AT TESCO. WHAT DOES THAT ROLE INVOLVE? 
    I lead social media, content marketing and influencer activations which includes the biggest free UK magazine, the number three food recipe content website reaching millions of customers with billions of views per year. I love being part of a dynamic, fun, fast-paced, creative and inclusive environment where I am able to deliver exciting, bold, innovative results driven work that our customers love. 
    #YOU’RE ALSO THE CO-CHAIR OF THE LGBTQ+ NETWORK AT TESCO. WHAT DOES TESCO DO TO SUPPORT ITS LGBTQ+ WORKERS AND COLLEAGUES? 
    The LGBTQ+ network has more than 2,500 members and aims to provide psychologically safe spaces for our colleagues, to help them feel like they belong and can thrive. We celebrate the wonderful, diverse and vibrant members of our communities, amplifying LGBTQ+ voices and support colleagues to enable them to bring their authentic selves to work each and every day. We also help educate our colleagues to understand different identities, how to be fully inclusive and a great ally.',

    'content' => '#HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS FOR A PERSON TO BE OUT AT WORK? 
    Personally, I think it’s incredibly important. Everyone should feel empowered to be their true selves without fear of judgment. To feel seen, heard, valued and respected, to be able to freely express differing perspectives, ideas and opinions brings so much richness to any situation. For me, hiding my true self for years was exhausting, stifling and not the best use of my energies. Being out has allowed me to really thrive and progress, I hope my visibility gives others the confidence to do the same in their own time and way.',

    Absolutely. Diversity brings better thinking, outcomes and workplaces. But it’s inclusion that brings it to life. When people feel safe and celebrated, they flourish. Creating psychological safety through developing spaces where people can be their true, authentic selves is where the magic happens. We achieve this by active listening, representation, education, and real allyship – not just in moments of celebration, but in the quieter, everyday actions too.
    #DESCRIBE A TYPICAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF DAN PORTER. 
    No day is ever typical — which I love.  
    I could be presenting on stage to hundreds of people, being on set at a shoot, reviewing creative for our next big campaign or working with our LGBTQ+ Network in stores. I try  to lead with kindness, clarity, and curiosity.  
    I believe in celebrating the small wins, lifting others up, and making time to check in.  People matter and are at the heart of everything we do. Working in retail can be  
    a very busy and reactive environment; it’s the people that keep me going, make me want to strive to be a better all round person. Outside  of work, I’m a big fashion, music and theatre fan, I love to read and find my peace in the garden up to my elbows in soil! I have just rejoined the gym so I’m looking forward to getting more active.',

    'content' => '#ON A PERSONAL OR A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT? 
    Professionally, there are lots of things I am really proud of. One of my best achievements is The Voice of The Checkout campaign. We created a talking checkout on TikTok inspired by the popular face filter app and using the duet feature to give customers the chance to become the voice of a Tesco checkout. We got the nation talking, with more than 48m views, trending for 10 days, global press pick up, seven prestigious industry award wins and more than 3K entries. Personally, co-chairing the network is a huge honour; through the work I do my ambition is always to play it forward and to be the role model I needed growing up.',
