    'content' => '#WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND?
    I’m Zac, born and raised in Sydney, Australia, but my husband, dog and I swapped the harbour for the Thames about four years ago and are now proud Londoners. I’ve always had a deep interest in history, especially the history of social change and discovering the often decisive role queer personalities played in those key turning points in time. Professionally, I am a dispute resolution lawyer, which, I think, is a natural extension of this interest. The law is, in some respects, applied history. Lawmakers weigh up different factual accounts of the past to determine the way the law should shape our rights, obligations, and the way we live together going forward. It is a deeply rewarding profession. 
    #YOU ARE A SENIOR LEGAL COUNSEL AND CHAIR OF PRIDE@REVOLUT. WHO ARE REVOLUT AND WHAT DOES YOUR ROLE INVOLVE?
    Revolut is unlike any other company; it’s a true unicorn. We are a global fintech, based in London, on a mission to simplify all things money, and empower our customers to achieve their financial goals through innovative and effortless banking solutions. We have a dream team of over 10,000 Revoluters who are building a seamless, intuitive platform and designing best-in-class products that our customers love. From multi-currency wallets, to investing, borrowing, and lifestyle benefits like travel insurance, data, airport lounges, and more. It’s a fast-paced, exciting place to work. 
    As for my role, I sit in the Legal Team where I provide legal advice on all sorts of contentious and strategic matters, paving the way for Revolut’s continued success. I am also the Chair of Revolut’s Pride network - a community of over 500 fiercely proud LGBTQ+ and Allied Revoluters. Our mission is to empower our colleagues old and new to bring their truest and best selves to work, to unlock their full professional potential, and to ensure Revolut’s products are authentic and appropriate for LGBTQ+ customers.

    'content' => '#HOW IMPORTANT IS A CLIMATE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION?
    It is absolutely essential. A diversity of ideas and experiences is vital for developing innovative, relevant products in the financial services market. Revolut has experienced tremendous growth in recent years that would not have been possible without fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce.
    We recognise that without genuine diversity and inclusion, there is a risk of becoming an echo chamber where ideas go unchallenged and opportunities are missed. 
    Diversity is equally important beyond the workplace. It enriches our day-to-day lives, and, speaking for myself, I’d probably get quite bored living in a community where everyone looked, thought and believed the same thing.
    Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like being challenged, am naturally curious, and genuinely think people flourish when they dare to be different. ',

    'content' => '#AND HOW DO WE CREATE THAT KIND OF INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT?
    I am a big advocate for strategies that empower and challenge people to be the best versions of themselves, which I think are highly effective when couched in positivity and optimism. I like this approach because it is inherently ambitious; and bold, ambitious plans driven by enthusiastic individuals tend to succeed at Revolut. 
    #WE’VE MADE PROGRESS IN LGBTQ+ RIGHTS. IS THE FIGHT WON – OR IS THERE MORE TO DO?
    There’s still important work to be done. I worry that, as time passes, we risk forgetting the pivotal struggles that have shaped our rights — the Holocaust, the Stonewall riots, the AIDS crisis, and many others. These events carry hard-earned lessons, and forgetting them opens the door to complacency. Progress is not permanent. Any student of history will tell you that freedoms, once won, can be quietly eroded. Our responsibility is to protect the gains we’ve made and continue pushing forward, so the next generation inherits a world more just, inclusive, and aware than the one our predecessors were born into.',

    'content' => '#WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT?
    My proudest personal achievement would certainly be my marriage here in London  
    last August. I grew up in a time when being openly gay at school was a fate worse than death, and marriage between two men was inconceivable. So to marry the love of my life before so many friends and family on a beautiful English summer’s day was a surreal, powerfully moving experience I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.
    Professionally, I am most proud of the role I played in advancing Revolut’s application for a UK banking licence last year. It was a privilege to be part of a tight-knit team making the case for Revolut to be the UK’s freshest bank. 
    #PRIDE – PARTY OR POLITICS?
    For me, Pride is a celebration. Of course, the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ+ people are derived from legal and political change, but  
    I take Pride month as a moment to celebrate. LGBTQ+ parties in particular, have been  hugely formative spaces for me, where I’ve come into my own and felt truly comfortable  in my identity. I’ve met people like me, and wildly different people, and through that experience witnessed how brilliant and special the LGBTQ+ community is. It was on the dance floor at an LGBTQ+ party at university that I met my now husband, so I know first-hand of the joy that the “party” side of Pride can bring. ',
